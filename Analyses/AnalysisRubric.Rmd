#### Proverbs 4:7

"Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding."

<br />


### Rubric Categories

There are five main elements to a good statistical analysis.

<div style="padding-left:15px;">

{ } Questions and Hypotheses

{ } Data Analysis

{ } Graphical Summaries

{ } Interpretation

{ } Presentation
     
</div>

<br />


### Category Points

Each Rubric Category is graded with a {**1**}, {**2**}, or {**3**}. 
  
<div style="padding-left:15px;">

{**1**} Major improvements needed.

{**2**} Modest improvements needed.

{**3**} Minor improvements needed.

</div>

</br>



Continued resubmissions are expected until you achieve a {**3**} in each Category.
