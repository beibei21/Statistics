```{r, include=FALSE}
library(mosaic)
Rent <- read.csv("../Data/Rent.csv", header=TRUE)
```

#### Background

I got data from the BYU-Idaho Housing Website. I wanted to see how much rent costs for BYUI students.

<br />

#### Analysis


```{r, echo=FALSE}
stripchart(Rent$Price, xlab="", main="")
```


#### Interpretation

Houssing seems to cost around a 1000 dollers.
